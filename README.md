## Project description
This small project is created to enable setting up Windows personalization by modifying registry files. App automatically loads current settings and displays it. 

App enables:
- changing from light mode to dark mode (app mode and Windows mode separately)
- changing Start color (including taskbar and start menu or only start menu)
- activation of window borders (after Windows restart)
- bringing back "old context menu"
- turning on and off transparency

## How it works
