## Project description
This small project is created to personalize Windows by modifying registry files. It was created to mitigate the soft lock in Windows, when the OS is not activated. App automatically loads current settings and displays it. App is designed for Windows 11 but most functionality of the application can also work on Windows 10. 

App enables:
- changing from light mode to dark mode (app mode and Windows mode separately)
- changing Start color (including taskbar and start menu or only start menu)
- activation of window borders (after Windows restart)
- bringing back "old context menu"
- turning on and off transparency

## How it works
The app is changing Windows registry values in order to change the personalization options
